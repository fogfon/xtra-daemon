# On https://www.qualcomm.com/site/privacy/services XTRA is described as

"XTRA â€“ Predicted GNSS Satellite Orbit Data. XTRA is technology offered 
by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. in the US and QT Technologies Ireland
Limited in the European Economic Area to improve mobile device
performance. XTRA downloads a data file from Qualcomm containing the
predicted orbits of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
atellites. Using the XTRA data file reduces the time the device needs
to calculate its location, thus saving time and battery power when 
using location-based applications. Newer versions of the XTRA software 
also upload a small amount of data to us. We use the uploaded data for 
purposes described in this Policy, such as maintaining and improving 
the quality, security, and integrity of the service. XTRA uploads the 
following data types: a randomly generated unique ID, the chipset name
and serial number, XTRA software version, the mobile country code and 
network code (allowing identification of country and wireless operator), 
the type of operating system and version, device make and model, the 
time since the last boot of the application processor and modem, and a 
list of our software on the device"
